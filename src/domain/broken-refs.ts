// DC-035a: maps and apps that point at hosted layers that are no longer in the org. Pure; read-only; no requests.
//
// It works only from what the scan already has: each map's or app's /data text, and the item ids and service names of the
// hosted feature services the search found. It never calls a referenced service url. Be strict: when in doubt, leave it out.
//
// A reference counts as missing only when ALL of these hold:
//  1. It is a layer object in the map's JSON whose `url` is on THIS org's hosted-services host
//     (https://services*.arcgis.com/<this org id>/arcgis/rest/services/<name>/FeatureServer). Anything else (other orgs,
//     public Esri content, ArcGIS Server, basemaps, tile and image layers, vector tiles) is never reported.
//  2. Neither its item id nor its service name matches a hosted feature service the search found. Views are in that
//     search, so a layer that points at a view is found. A layer that was re-created under the same name is found.
//  3. An item id is only used when it is a well-formed 32-hex id; otherwise the service name stands alone.
//  4. Maps and apps were all read (the caller passes depsComplete), and the search covered every hosted feature service
//     (the result set was not cut at the search cap), otherwise nothing is reported.
//  5. It is shown only to an admin. An admin's search sees other owners' private items; a member's search does not, so for
//     a member a private layer of someone else would look gone. The Review section says it compares with the org's layers.
// A layer that only carries an item id (no url) is never reported: it could be any item type the search does not list.
